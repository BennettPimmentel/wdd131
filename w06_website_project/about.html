      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        Healthy Morning Bakery was born from the desire to make breakfast both delicious and nourishing.
        What started as a small home project quickly grew into a community favorite.
        Our passion lies in creating breads infused with fruits and natural ingredients that bring joy and energy to your mornings.
      </p>
      <p>
        We carefully select each ingredient to ensure that every bite is full of flavor and nutrition.
        Our bakery stands for balance, where healthy meets tasty, and every loaf tells a story of love and dedication.
